# Publish

The **Publish** section of the sidebar is for choosing where photos are shown. Each photo JSON file has three fields
for it, which new saves write with their defaults: `isSocialMediaEligible` (`false`), whether the photo may be posted
to social media; `websiteSpotlight` (`null`), the photo's place among the photos spotlighted on the site, or `null`
when it isn't spotlighted; and `socialMediaPublishDate` (`null`), the day the photo is scheduled to post to social
media, as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Older files may be missing them, which means the same as the defaults.

`/instagram` is a calendar of the photos scheduled to post, one a day. It shows three weeks, starting with this one
(Sunday first), and pages a week at a time. Clicking an empty day picks a photo for it from the photo files, read
where Update Data reads them, so photos in flight on the **Add photo data** pull request are included and marked as
such (eligible photos first); clicking a scheduled photo changes or removes it. Dragging a photo to another
day moves it there, and dropping it on another photo swaps the two. The page reads the photo files with
`GET /api/publish/instagram`, each with its whole JSON as `data`.

Each change is kept in the app as a [local edit](combined-data-store.md#local-edits) right away: the sync button at the
top right counts the photo, and `ALLPHOTOS.json` in the app shows the new date. Nothing goes to GitHub until
**Commit**, which sets `socialMediaPublishDate` in each changed photo file in the same commit as `ALLPHOTOS.json`. Only
that field changes in each file. (`PUT /api/publish/instagram`, which saves dates on their own, is still there but the
page doesn't use it.)

> **Frontend analogy:** it's a draft kept in a client-side store (persisted to `localStorage`) instead of component
> state, so it survives a reload and other pages can see it; Commit is the one "Save all" request.

`/site-spotlight` is still a stub; ways to change the other fields will come later.
