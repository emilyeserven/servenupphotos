# servenupphotos

Monorepo for a photography portfolio and the local tooling that feeds it.

| App                 | Path                   | Stack                                           | Runs on                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **portfolio**       | `apps/portfolio`       | React, TanStack Router + Query, shadcn/ui, Vite | GitHub Pages (static)        |
| **client-pipeline** | `apps/client-pipeline` | React, TanStack Router + Query, shadcn/ui, Vite | Served by `bff-pipeline`     |
| **bff-pipeline**    | `apps/bff-pipeline`    | Fastify (TypeScript)                            | Local machine / Raspberry Pi |
| **be-pipeline**     | `apps/be-pipeline`     | Go (stdlib `net/http`)                          | Local machine / Raspberry Pi |

The three `*-pipeline` apps deploy together as one tool: the browser talks only to the BFF, and the BFF talks to the Go backend.

```
browser ──► bff-pipeline (Fastify, :8080) ──► be-pipeline (Go, :8081)
              └─ serves client-pipeline build
```

## Requirements

- Node 22 (`.nvmrc`) and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`)
- Go 1.24
- Docker, for running the pipeline on a Pi

## Development

```sh
pnpm install

pnpm dev:portfolio   # http://localhost:5173/servenupphotos/
pnpm dev:pipeline    # Go :8081 + Fastify :8080 + Vite :5173 (proxies /api → :8080)
```

## Checks (same as CI)

```sh
pnpm lint        # oxlint
pnpm fmt:check   # oxfmt --check   (pnpm fmt to write)
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --noEmit in each TS app
pnpm fallow      # dead code, duplication, complexity
pnpm check       # all of the above

cd apps/be-pipeline && gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go test ./...
```

## Deploying

### Portfolio → GitHub Pages

`.github/workflows/deploy-portfolio.yml` builds `apps/portfolio` on every push to `main` and deploys it.
One-time setup: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions**.
The site is served from `/servenupphotos/` (Vite `base`), and `404.html` is a copy of `index.html` so deep links work.

### Pipeline → local machine or Raspberry Pi

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build   # UI + API on http://<host>:8080
```

The Dockerfiles are multi-arch, so the same command works on an arm64 Raspberry Pi (64-bit OS).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Image optimization and cropping (be-pipeline)
- [ ] Upload to Cloudflare R2 (`apps/be-pipeline/internal/storage`; see the `R2_*` vars in `.env.example`)
- [ ] Generate gallery JSON into `apps/portfolio/src/data/` and render it in the portfolio
